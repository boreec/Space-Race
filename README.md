# Space Race

This game is an amateur reproduction of the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race_(video_game)) game initially created by Atari, Inc. in 1973.

This program was built completely with rust and the sdl2 bindings.

## How to run ?

Use **cargo** to build and run the program:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Troubleshooting

If you have issues building the program, make sure the following packages are installed on the system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-1.0.0 libsdl2-gfx-dev
```
