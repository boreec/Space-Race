This game is an amateur reproduction of Space Race made by Atari.

## How to run ?

Use **cargo** to build and run the program:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Troubleshooting

If you have issues building the program, make sure the following packages are installed on the system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-1.0.0 libsdl2-gfx-dev
```
